   <h2 class="a">1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
   By accessing or using the Local Eats website, you agree to be legally bound by these Terms of Service. These terms form a binding agreement between you (the user) and Local Eats, governing your use of the site and its content. If you do not agree to these terms, you should refrain from using the site. These terms apply regardless of whether you access Local Eats via desktop, mobile device, or any other platform. Your continued use of the website following any updates or changes to these terms constitutes your acceptance of those revisions. We encourage you to review the terms periodically to stay informed about any modifications. These terms cover all site users, including guests, registered users, and business partners.

 <br><h2 class="a">2. About Local Eats</h2>
  Local Eats is an online platform that provides curated information about local food establishments, including restaurants, cafes, bars, and food vendors. Our mission is to help users discover new and exciting culinary experiences within their local communities. We aggregate information such as location details, hours of operation, menus, images, and user reviews (if available). While we strive to maintain accurate and updated listings, we cannot guarantee the completeness, timeliness, or correctness of all data. Local Eats does not own or operate any of the businesses featured on the platform and is not responsible for their services. We serve as a digital directory, not a food delivery or reservation service. The inclusion of any business on our platform does not imply endorsement, and users are advised to independently verify any details before making decisions based on our listings. We reserve the right to modify or remove listings as necessary.
