<h2 class="about">Our Story</h2>
Founded in 2025, Local Eats began with a simple observation ‚Äî small, authentic local food spots were often overlooked in favor of big chains and heavily advertised venues. Our founders, passionate food lovers and digital natives, envisioned a platform that celebrated the undiscovered, the authentic, and the local. What started as a side project to map favorite hidden gems in Sydney has now grown into a fast-growing digital guide that supports community-based food culture. We‚Äôre not just another listing site ‚Äî we‚Äôre a movement dedicated to celebrating the people, flavors, and cultures that make local food scenes so special.
